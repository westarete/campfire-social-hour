  <h1>About this app</h1>

  <p>We created and donated this app to the InCommon community because we couldn&apos;t find another social hour app that put accessibility first. What good is a social tool if it shuts certain people out?</p>

  <p>The back end was created by <a href='https://westarete.com/'>West Arete</a>. We&apos;re one of the InCommon Catalysts. We&apos;re a certified benefit corporation that helps universities build and sustain their own custom software. Do you have a home-grown app that is rusty or abandoned? An app or vendor that needs better integration with your identity services? A software concept that needs strategy and implementation? We would love to hear about it to see how we might help. Say hello to Scott or Natalie at the conference, or email us at <a href='mailto:team@westarete.com'>team@westarete.com</a>.</p>

  <p>In the spirit of most of our work, all of the software for this app is open source. We&apos;re thrilled if you can use or adapt this software for your own conferences and gatherings. And please <a href='https://westarete.com/contact/'>contact us</a> if you&apos;d us to customize or host it for you.</p>
